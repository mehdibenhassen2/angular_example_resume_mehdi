  The CGG is a geophysical services company. The company provides seismic data acquisition, processing and
  interpretation services, as well as related processing and interpretation software to clients in the oil and gas
  exploration. Usually, the CGG use the Reflection seismology : a method of exploration geophysics that uses the
  principles of seismology to estimate the properties of the Earth's subsurface from reflected seismic waves.



  Seismic vibrators send underground soundwaves. The echo helps to have the 3D image of underground and to locate the
  crude oil. But these vibrations can damage buildings and all underground networks (power grid, sanitation networks,
  water supply system. So, to solve this issue, we used the GIS.



  The vertical and horizontal seismic lines are spaced 250 m, and in the same line, the vibration points are spaced 50
  m. We used Model builder:
  <ul>
    <li> Create fishnet: creates a feature class containing a net of rectangular cells (250 m) </li>
    <li> Densify: adds Feature Vertices along seismic line and define the distance between vertices (50 m). </li>
    <li> Feature Vertices to Points: Creates a feature class containing points generated from vertices . </li>
    <li> Clip: remove all outside points.</li>
  </ul>
