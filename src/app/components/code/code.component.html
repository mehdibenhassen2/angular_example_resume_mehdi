    This single web page was developed using angular8, html5, scss.
  </p>
  <p>This project is just a simple including the architecture, the design, the content, the code writing and the app
    deployment.
  </p>
  <p>
    I tried in this project to use the maximum tools offered by angular ( use of smart and dump component, service,
    module, interface, routing, data binding, httpClient get and post request, and more).
  </p>
  <p>
    For deployement, I used firebase (also used for storage and database).
